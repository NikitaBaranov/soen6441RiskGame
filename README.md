# Development
Open project in Intellij Idea and run Launcher via default build configuration.

# Contribution
The master branch is made secure to avoid errors (i.e. protected), so you are not able to push directly to master branch.

Steps to contribute:
* Clone the project to your PC
* Create new branch with adequate name following the convention 
    Bad names: new-branch, branch1, sucker
    Good names: [issue number]-[description] or [verb-description] i.e. 3-save-game or 2-load-map or add-map-editor
* Do some work
* Commit your changes
* Push your changes to the remote repository (i.e. Github)
* Create a pull request from your branch to master branch and assign others as reviewers
